Hyper-Threading Virtual Private Network is a work-in-progress idea for a multi-server VPN. It is made to be quick, but at the same time also high in security. This is done by splitting the VPN over multiple servers that can be used to get access to the VPN (see it as access points that give wireless access to the router (and use the same network due to connection), but instead of choosing the closest one and giving wireless access it goes for a random one and gives access to the internet safely in general). Because of this load can be reduced and the connected clients can be split over multiple servers within the VPN network allowing for better performance. It can improve security if the connected networks all are on different real networks, so that the IPs are different. Since you switch with the paired/connected servers every 30 seconds to another, it will change your IP every 30 seconds to the one that the then connected server uses thus your IP becomes dynamic and not your main, real one. In case it's on the same network, it doesn't really improve security, but can improve performance. In that case it's also handy to use to connect all your devices together, and access them when you're out of your real home network.
